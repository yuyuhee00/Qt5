/*

  What
  Bridge Design Pattern

  Description
  Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
  Note interfaces make this simple

  Why
  We want code reuse
  This is a design choice!
  Done BEFORE the orginal classes are created

  Example
  Logger with interfaces
  You have probably seem this dozens of times
